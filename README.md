**  Internship Project - APSSDC AI & ML Internship**

  **Overview**
This repository contains the code and resources developed during my AI & ML internship with APSSDC, focusing on Sentiment Analysis for Restaurant Reviews. The project involves building a machine learning model to classify customer reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. It demonstrates my understanding of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Project Details
Problem Statement
Analyze customer reviews for restaurants and determine the sentiment expressed in each review (positive, negative, or neutral). This information can help restaurants improve customer satisfaction by addressing common concerns.

Solution Approach
The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to perform sentiment analysis. Key steps include:

Data Collection: Reviews are collected from various sources and pre-processed for analysis.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the text data by removing noise such as stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization and lemmatization.
Model Building: Implementing machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) using scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: (If applicable) Deploying the model using a simple web interface (HTML, CSS) for users to input reviews and get sentiment predictions.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
NLP Techniques: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal, TF-IDF Vectorization
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM
Version Control: Git
