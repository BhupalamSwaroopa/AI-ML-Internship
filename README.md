**Internship Project - APSSDC AI & ML Internship**

  **Overview**
  
This repository contains the code and resources developed during my AI & ML internship with APSSDC, focusing on Sentiment Analysis for Restaurant Reviews. The project involves building a machine learning model to classify customer reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. It demonstrates my understanding of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

**Problem Statement**

Analyze customer reviews for restaurants and determine the sentiment expressed in each review (positive, negative, or neutral). This information can help restaurants improve customer satisfaction by addressing common concerns.

**Solution Approach**

The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to perform sentiment analysis. Key steps include:

Data Collection: Reviews are collected from various sources and pre-processed for analysis.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the text data by removing noise such as stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization and lemmatization.

Model Building: Implementing machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) using scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: (If applicable) Deploying the model using a simple web interface (HTML, CSS) for users to input reviews and get sentiment predictions.

**Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
NLP Techniques: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal, TF-IDF Vectorization
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM
Version Control: Git
